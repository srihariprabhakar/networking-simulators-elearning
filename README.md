# Networking Protocol Simulators – HPE eLearning Module

## 🎓 Project Overview
Developed interactive digital simulations of key networking protocols to be used in Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal eLearning programs. Led a team of 3 to design and implement hands-on learning tools for protocols such as TCP/IP, BGP, RIP, OSPF, SMTP, and HTTP.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Adobe Captivate
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Wireshark (for packet flow analysis)
- Instructional design methodologies

## 🌐 Protocols Simulated
- TCP/IP stack and packet flow
- Routing protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP
- Application layer: HTTP, SMTP

## 📚 Outcomes
- Simulations deployed across HPE global internal training
- Enhanced protocol understanding for 1000+ employees
- Bridged theory with hands-on virtual learning

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Instructional design for technical topics
- Simplifying complex networking concepts
- End-to-end project development and team coordination
